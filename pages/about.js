              The purpose of this resume book is to showcase the diversity of talent in the
              Jerome Fisher Program in Management and Technology at the University of Pennsylvania. It is important to note that not all students in the Jerome Fisher Program
              are featured in this book and that not all students included in this book are actively
              seeking employment.

              This resume book aims to highlight the academic foci of the Program’s students
              along with their unique skill sets and interests. Given the interdisciplinary nature of
              the students’ curricula, many of them are particularly well-positioned to embark in
              internships and careers beginning in product management, management consulting, financial technologies, venture capital, and entrepreneurship.

              Outside the classroom, Jerome Fisher Program students are involved in leading
              student run initiatives on campus. They can be found in student government,
              pre-professional consulting and investing clubs, student-run small-business incubators, investment funds, and even varsity sports.
              Perhaps what makes the Program a truly impressive and well-rounded community
              of students is the wide-variety of interesting ventures our students explore. From
              the development of a commercial video game to authoring books and creating art,
              Jerome Fisher Program students are true innovators and game-changers.
